# PPMS Data Processing Kit

Physical Property Measuring System, short for PPMS is a powerful instrument which allows us to acquire, as its name, many different physics properties of different kinds of sample to a good precision.

The raw data directly output from the machine needs some pre-processing, then to be useful for multiple purpose. And some useful functions are used repeatly to plot, fit or extrapolate the data. So a collection of these useful function neatly written could be helpful for future me or any other people comes after.
